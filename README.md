# Digital-radio
Analog radios that currently exist are actually a receiver of surrounding signals and with the help of electrical components pass through as a filter and transfer the filtered filter to the hearing range of the human ear with a shift in the frequency domain.


In this project, an input, which is actually an item in the air, is given to the program, and the program broadcasts the radio network considering the desired frequency of a radio.
